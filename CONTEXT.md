# HubToHome

HubToHome is a Unity RPG project whose player-facing flow moves between overworld exploration, battle presentation, dialogue, and menu-driven actions.

**Overworld Menu Shell**:
The exploration menu surface that frames category choice, party status, and money without itself being a category's content.
_Avoid_: Options panel, pause menu, inventory window

**Category Window**:
The framed content area associated with one selected Overworld Menu Shell category: ITEM, EQUIP, POWER, or CONFIG.
_Avoid_: Main menu, dialogue box

**Config Panel**:
The existing options surface for changing game settings. It is distinct from the Overworld Menu Shell even when settings are reached from an overworld menu category.
_Avoid_: Overworld menu

## Example Dialogue

Developer: "Pressing C should open the Overworld Menu Shell, not the Config Panel."

Designer: "Then the player chooses ITEM, EQUIP, POWER, or CONFIG from the shell."

Developer: "Choosing a category opens its Category Window; CONFIG may show settings later, but the shell and the Config Panel are still separate concepts."
